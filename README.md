# 16-bit-CPU
This folder contains a 16 bit CPU project completed using System Verilog. Here is a brief summary of the project:
• uses System Verilog, implementing ARMv7 instructions for input-output (ADD, MVN, CMP, AND), memory/register operations (STR, LDR, MOV), and branching (B, BEQ, BNE, BLT, BLE)
•	Built a comprehensive System Verilog testbench to rigorously evaluate CPU functionalities, ensuring reliability and accuracy
•	Performed waveform analysis utilizing ModelSim, systematically identifying and resolving intricate bugs, including challenging edge cases, to enhance CPU performance and stability

Time took to complete: 3 weeks
